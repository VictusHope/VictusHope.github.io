				<p class="ital">Star Captain Miles Avery ID 0064E7 Released
					<br>Response Requested::
					<br>Emergency Maintenance Check Issued 007:1342:52:32.
					<br>Chambers Decompressing…</p>
				<p>Cool air hits the back of my lungs. The ringing voice reverberating in my head brings me to my senses as rushing air follows the clink of a gear falling into place.</p>
				<p class="ital">Chambers Decompressed...
					<br>Releasing Hatch...
					<br>Environment Stabilized Until 007:1348:52:32.
					<br>Hatch Released.</p>
				<p>A whirring sound pierces the silence. I pry open my eyes and see a fog billowing out into the halls of the Aspire-F:01, a state of the art ship designed in probing other planets for habitable ecosystems. Seven years the ship has been exploring our solar system and relaying information back to Atlas, a research station at the edges of an Earth debris field.</p>
				<p>The Aspire model has cutting edge technology used for communication and moving through space with minimal resources; only to return to Atlas once invaluable data has been gathered, or after three hundred years, when the resources are speculated to deplete.</p>
				<p>A myriad of cryogenic chambers range the hall, each one as clean as the day that the Aspire set out. Frozen eyes stare out from the capsules as I stumble out of the open capsule, my body weak from muscle atrophy. I find my way across the hall and prop myself up against the wall on the other end of the hall, clearing my throat. “Aspire open door." My voice reverberates through the room, followed by silence. A response calls back shortly.</p>
				<p class="ital">Door E57 Unsealing...
					<br>Padlocks start to unhinge and rotate in a seemingly complex arrangement.
					<br>Door E57 Unsealed.</p>
				<p>The door slides open revealing a vast empty space centered on a cube. White walls enclose from each direction except ahead of me where a vast darkness lies beyond a cold glass surface. The hair at the back of my neck begins to rise as I make out something beyond the glass. I run towards the cube and as I touch it a digitized voice calmly speaks out with an ambient voice.</p>
				<p class="ital">Password Requested::</p>
				<p>I reach into my pocket and pull out a card placing my thumb over a small circle. The card springs to life as the holographic characters start to rapidly change. Slowly each character settles and after all the characters stop shifting I clear my throat. “A, E, Theta, E, R, Seven, Two, Six, Theta, B, Four, Six, Z, Y.”</p>
				<p class="ital">Password Correct::
					<br>Accessing Security Protocols...
					<br>Emergency Response Requested::
					<br>Decompressing Atmosphere In Six Hours::
					<br>Tracking Collision Object F54…
					<br>Parsing Error::
					<br>Gravity Sensors Malfunctioning::
					<br>Enabling Archimedes…</p>
				<p>Another voice springs to life - this time that of a male. “Archimedes at your service Star Captain Avery!” With a smile I call back to the intelligence system. “Good to see you again Archimedes. Not a routine checkup this time I presume.” Archimedes processes for a second before speaking out “No routine checkup, more of an emergency situation. A parsing error had occurred when our routine checkup system was unable to calculate the mass, acceleration, or velocity of object F54, a small body about the size of Aspire and about twenty minutes away by shuttle - or an hour until collision.”</p>
				<p>I stand at the basin of the cube patiently tapping my fingers in an unknown rhythm. As my addled senses begin to focus I start to recollect my thoughts and proceed motion my hand over the cube and the empty space becomes overwhelmed with holograms. “Anything else?”</p>
				<p>Archimedes responds “There are three planetary bodies close to our ship that seem to be affecting our gravity sensors. However they are unmapped so we couldn't compensate for them. Nothing too large, eventually our ship will break out of its orbit if we can figure out how to deal with the collision object. Emergency shuttle to probe scan would be my recommendation sir."</p>
				<p>I scan through the holograms and after a few flustered seconds I scream out, “Archimedes bring forth chambers. A-G” All the holograms begin to move out of the way as a series of small blue screens travel towards me.</p>
				<p>"No need to yell sir." Archimedes chimes in after giving me the controllers I requested. Seven divisions are displayed across the Aspire's lodging areas – one being the captain’s chamber housed with backup captains in case of an untimely demise. The other six areas are noticeably larger and house the various professions that are required for research and survival.</p>
				<p>I quickly tap the six segments and begin to manipulate the controllers. I proceed to release two cadets from each segment, barely paying attention to who i’m releasing, and then quickly zoom in on the pilots area. Twenty frozen pilots range down the hall each with colors corresponding to their status.</p>
				<p>A few of them glow red as an indication of death or disability, while others glow blue as an indication of expertise and status. My fingers find one of the blue labeled chambers and I tap it. A screen pops up. My heart rate quickens as I notice her features. Her red hair lays softly around her shoulders and her freckles dotting every segment of her face.</p>
				<p>To the right of the picture is the text reading out her name and status: Ashelynn Sivra, Chief Pilot. I quickly back out and then select the adviser's tab. I promptly select another person and another name pops up: Ephraim Cellic, Adviser. “Bring up details of revived cadets.”</p>
				<p>The seven screens slide to my right as another screen shifts to the front. I start to scan through each cadet to see their strengths as I formulate who we may need. Between the ten cadets I released I have enough hands to form a team of six and a team of five. I start to mentally organize each cadet: one pilot, two mechanics, two soldiers, two medics, two scholars, and two technicians.</p>
				<p class="ital">Lev Iton ID Ma-0063E7 Released
					<br>Raelyn Feste ID Ma-0051E4 Released
					<br>Boaz ID Unknown Released
					<br>Ira ID Unknown Released
					<br>Lloyd Ester ID Unknown Released

					<br>Ashelynn Sivra ID Pi-0036D2 Released</p>
				<p>Archimedes finishes naming each cadet, as a formal greeting to the cadets more so than any useful information to me. I turn to leave the room and progress into another larger room. I approach the center and take out the key-card I used earlier to activate the control cube. I slide it into a slot in the floor and a small hexagon begins to rise out of the floor.</p>
				<p>I step into the elevator and tap a button on one of the walls. The platform drops and within a second I’m standing on a different floor. Around me stands the eleven other cadets, each one with a badge associating their status. I immediately scan the halls in search for Ashelynn. Her flame colored hair catches my eyes almost instantly. I step out of the chamber and proudly greet the crew.</p>
				<p>“Rise and shine. We have an emergency. There is an asteroid we are running a risk of colliding with, so we are going to have to do a dual-impulse detonation routine to try and displace it. It should be a simple process. First thing is first; we have to split into groups. One person of each division will be in each team."</p>
				<p>I look at Ashelynn and continue my monologue “You will be leading the second team with Ephraim. Two shuttles is the easiest method to direct an impulse detonation. A simple task then we can celebrate."</p>
				<p>I ponder to myself for a few minutes, clapping my hands together after a moment's hesitation. “It should also be noted that we are currently in orbit with a planet as we speak. It is a minor side note,  but somehow went undetected in our mass relay. At least you guys will get to enjoy the view. Ephraim you stay here, everyone else meet me in the shuttle bay. We will be leaving in under half an hour and I can explain more details about the mission on the way there. Dismissed.” Each cadet begins to step out of their orderly line and exit the hall.</p>
				<p>When the last cadet leaves I turn to Ephraim. “Follow me.” I escort Ephraim to a door on the other side of the hall. It slides open as we approach and Ephraim takes a gasp. A view of a massive planet colored green ranges out from the investigations chamber.</p>
				<p>“Typically we aren’t supposed to enter this close to orbit but we are stuck in a gravitational pull. Archimedes should be able to handle the Aspire, but the shuttles under our jurisdiction will be heavily influenced. We will also need the calculations of where to push the asteroid. Pushing it further from the planet will requires too many impulse detonations and too many squadrons. Pushing it further to the planet could be potentially cataclysmic to whatever life lies below; if any. We need to push it along the curvature of the planet and dislodge it.”</p>
				<p>Ephraim just nods and then replies with a hoarse dry voice. “Understood, I’m just trying to figure out how something went under our mass relay. A planet of this size should have been easily notable.” I look at him with a smile. “Yes I agree… Something we will have to figure out.”</p>
				<p>Ephraim questions “What is the mass and velocity of the collision object?” I reply with a slight tinge of disdain. “This mission was caused by a parsing error - we couldn’t determine those. Seems like something we will have to do once we reach the asteroid I'd say that a simple seven probe-relay should help us with that."</p>
				<p>Ephraim’s face remains calm. He takes a deep breath and turns on his heels. “If that is it, then I will meet you in the shuttle bay soon. I’m going to go collect what tools I may need. I'll make some spare impulse detonators and see if anyone else needs help around the ship."</p>
				<p>I turn towards the window again. "Archimedes, can you do a few fifteen probe relays on this planet and instantly transmit the results back to Atlas?" Archimedes responds promptly "One of the fifteen probe relays is already in effect sir. Other probes are being prepared." I turn towards the window and try to sift through my emotions. Are we here?</p>
