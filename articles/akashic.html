				<p class="title">Interlude</p>
				<p class="author">Written and Edited By: Jason Hope</p>
				<p>“War destroys all, yet all have the power to dismiss war. It wasn't war that took my planet however, it was an act of pure chance. An ill omen spread to the lamenting souls left behind. The only hope humanity had was to take a leap of faith into the void. Some say that when we entered the void, the void entered us. Apophis hit in 2026, or that is what we have always been told, and it was on that day that Earth became a graveyard. The impact wiped out known life on the planet, yet humans persevere. If there is one things humans can do it is persevere.</p>
				<p>Years before Apophis hit, Arc, a vessel that contains all the topographical data of Earth alongside the DNA for each known species, was created. All stored on a cube-like storage device. Many living species that were seen as necessities for comfortable living were cultivated under the drifting bio-dome. Humans survive tragedies, but war always stands on the brink.</p>
				<p>We are the humans that seek a new home. We aspire to something so much greater than war, but to bring back the ground beneath our feet. Something none of us have experienced, yet all of us hope to.</p>
				<p>We stare into the void on a daily basis, and the only scraps of human identity that we have left is our own sapience. Perhaps we can find a world beyond ours – a new home. Until then, my duty is to uphold the civility of our ship, and to maintain order to ensure that our mission is smooth.  That is the Star Captain’s oath, and I hold true to it.  Broadcast out.”</p>

				<p>A surreal omnipresent darkness fills my vision as a familiar feeling bites at my consciousness, its origin not known to me. The stench of rotting flesh fills my nostrils as I feel the grit of sand grinding against my bare skin.  A numbness envelopes my every sense as the darkness is wiped away and replaced with a star baring down on the barren wasteland that surrounds me, heat shedding sweat off my skin. Beneath my feet the cracked ground ranges as far as I can see.</p>
				<p> It begins to violently shake and a shiver runs up my spine and disperses through my body. In the distance I can make out a cloud rising and expanding towards me. An intense heat consumes me and within a few seconds the intensity of the wave increases as my skin peels back. A fissure rips through the earth. Darkness surrounds me, and all the pain and color leave as fast as they came.</p>
				<p>Gravity pulls me down for what feels like an eternity. Suddenly my knees buckle under my own momentum and a searing pain jolts through my bones. I force my eyes away from my broken legs and I’m able to make out a short silhouette of someone young with their back turned against me.  Sobbing sounds emit from a shadow and I feel my body pulling closer to the source.  The figure of a girl no more than seven years old crouches over a shadow and her sobs begin to soften.</p>
				<p>As I trudge towards her, each step taken with a sharp pain, the distance between us lengthens. Her face turns towards me and then a growling echoes through the room.  “Wolfie, do they come to play?”  Her last words circle in my head even after her shape disappears from the void settling around me.  Loneliness presses in from all sides again. A siren pierces the newfound nothingness. A voice echoes alongside the alarm as the world fades before me.</p>
