				<p class="author">Written and Edited By: Justin Sanderson</p>
				<p>Have you ever thought to yourself that Jenga would be an addicting sport if only it had more engaging elements? If you are one of the few people to have had this thought, fear not: A new fad called Jenga Siege is sweeping the nation.</p>
				<p>Coined by enthusiasts of the sport, Jenga Siege is an unofficial deviation from the traditional block-stacking game. In Siege, the tower is constructed of larger, brick-sized blocks of wood. After a block is carefully removed and placed on top of the tower, a player from an opposite team strategically throws a bean bag at the tower while the player who just removed a block attempts to block the shot. When the tower falls to a bean bag, the thrower's team wins.</p>
				<p>While Jenga Siege might sound like a bit of high-intensity fun, the enthusiasts and culture surrounding the game are beginning to become a major problem in urban centers. Owners of night-clubs, bars, and lounges are feeling increased pressure to offer Jenga Siege due to hordes of fans demanding a place to play. We spoke to one bar owner in Miami who described the process to us.</p>
				<p>"They, the Siege people, get set up in one bar by some sucker for gaming or gaming place in a couple of cities now. When it starts to fill up and people get turned away, they start filling up the other establishments and demanding a big Jenga tower and bean bags. You... You don't have a choice because your regulars can't even get in and it's great for you as a business - if you can stand the volume and the... the crashing and the yelling, that is."</p>
				<p>While Siege may be offering increased profits for those willing to host the fans, many nightlife locals feel disturbed and rejected by the sudden change. We spoke to over a dozen patrons in the Riverside area of Jacksonville who were hopeful that the fad would pass and that the area would return to normalcy.</p>
				<p>Through our interviews, we found out that Eclipse Nightclub was the source of the Jenga Siege epidemic in this part of Florida. After waiting in line for almost an hour to get in, the former goth club had been clearly retrofitted to support as many games of Siege as possible. What was once a dance floor now showcased six three-foot tall Jenga towers.</p>
				<p>A patron named Jesse Pausche, who requested not to be identified, gave us the scoop on how he felt about the epidemic.</p>
				<p>"...It's fucking ridiculous. You can't even get in here anymore. I mean, look at the line to get in. You used to be able to dance but there's a tower every five fucking feet inside and you can't hear shit because of the screaming of 'Jenga!' and the crashing every five seconds."</p>
				<p>Jesse takes a drag of his cigarette and stares over the exterior fence where he is forced to stand because of the crowd.</p>
				<p>The bartenders inside seemed overworked but thrilled at the prospect of all of the new patrons. They've tried their best to be accomodating and it shows. In between orders from Siege players, a bartender gives us his thoughts.</p>
				<p>"Business is better than ever. It's not exactly the 'old' Eclipse but times are changing and we are willing to change with it. We love our people."</p>
				<p>If this is the new standard for urban nightlife, the only question that remains is what the Jenga Siege players think about the old crowds. On what used to be the dance floor, we attempted to get opinions from a team that just won their first round of competitive Jenga Siege. Despite a patron jumping on a speaker and inciting a crowd to chant the title of the popular game and despite a hurricane of toasts, bean-bags, and crashing Jenga towers, we managed to catch a few words.</p>
				<p>"Who cares if those stale old farts want to mingle and reminisce and shit? 'Cause I don't give a rat's ass for real, for real, for real! Jenga Siege is the new world order and it's on top and that's the way it is!"</p>
				<p>"There ain't nothing those people want but to ruin a good time. They just sorry that they ain't any good at Jenga and so they stay bitter. Nobody got time for any of that."</p>
				<p>"I don't know. Personally, I feel pretty apathetic to their struggles and, like, their problems and stuff but stuff changes all the time and if they can't adapt then they just need to stay home. We're having a great time out here and we're not going to let anyone knock us down."</p>
