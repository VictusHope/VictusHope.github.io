				<h2>VictusTech History</h2>
				<p class="title">Founder</p>
				<p>History I still need help with the details of but I have some stuff: VictusTech was formed as an emergency tech coalition during WWII to combat German tech advances. It grew into a shadow company that specialized in fulfillment of black project orders and laid the ground for many of the scientific feats possible today. During the Cold War era VictusTech moved away from practical war tech and pioneered into bioengineering, nueral interfacing, etc. Then throw in some stuff about how VictusTech's government contract has expired and under our recent leadership has decided to operate in the public sector to contribute to the everyday lives of the world.
